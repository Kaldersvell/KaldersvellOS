# Kaldersvell OS
Welcome to the repository hosting the built version of Kaldersvell OS, an Internet of Things focused Linux Distribution designed for the Raspberry Pi. It is made for makers, by makers.

### Information
Kaldersvell OS is heavily based on the "Lite" variation of Raspbian Linux, and we would like to thank the Raspbian team for their dedication to creating a version of Debian appropriate for the Raspberry Pi. 
Right now, differences between the distributions are minimal, but we hope to improve the performance of Raspbian as well as adding new and exciting features to help the maker community.
